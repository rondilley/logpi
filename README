== What is Log Peudo Indexer (logpi)?

== Why use it?

I built this tool to solve a log searching/analysis problem that I have
suffered through while responding to many security breaches.
Invariably, I need to find a needle in a haystack of log data.

If you need to find a something fast without the expense of parting and
indexing everything, then this is the tool for you.

== Implementation

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any stretch of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
