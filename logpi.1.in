.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Log Pseudo Indexer(\fllogpi\fP) is a high-performance log post-processor that provides fast
indexing for network addresses (IPv4, IPv6, and MAC addresses). The tool supports both serial
and parallel processing modes, automatically selecting parallel processing for files larger
than 100MB to achieve maximum throughput. Both modes produce identical index files with
perfect accuracy verification.

.SH OPTIONS
Command line options are described below.
.TP 5
.B \-d
Enable debug mode, the higher the \fllog\-level\fP, the more verbose the logging.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display help information and usage examples.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-serial
Force serial processing mode, disabling automatic parallel processing for large files.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version information.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-write
Auto-generate .lpi index files for each input file (input.log becomes input.log.lpi).
.TP
.B filename
One or more files to process. Use '\-' to read from stdin (not compatible with \-w).

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Process log file and display network addresses to stdout:
.B logpi
.I /var/log/syslog
.PP
.TP
Process log file and create index file (auto-naming):
.B logpi \-w
.I /var/log/syslog
.br
(Creates /var/log/syslog.lpi)
.PP
.TP
Force serial processing on large file:
.B logpi \-s \-w
.I large_logfile.log
.PP
.TP
Process multiple files with parallel processing:
.B logpi \-w
.I *.log
.PP
.TP
Real-time processing from stdin:
.B tail \-f /var/log/access.log | logpi \-
.PP
.TP

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B \fllogpi\fP 
returns 0 on normal program termination and 1 on error.  Additional diagnostic information is available through the \-d command line switch.

.SH PERFORMANCE
.LP
Performance varies based on processing mode:
.TP
.B Serial Mode
Processes approximately 60 million lines per minute on modern hardware.
Used automatically for files smaller than 100MB or when forced with \-s flag.
.TP
.B Parallel Mode  
Achieves 125+ million lines per minute throughput using multi-threaded processing.
Automatically enabled for files larger than 100MB with sufficient CPU cores available.
Progress reports are displayed every 60 seconds during processing.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
SIGHUP will cause \fllogpi\fP to quit gracefully.
.TP
SIGTERM will cause \fllogpi\fP to shutdown.
.TP
SIGALRM is used internally for progress reporting (every 60 seconds).
